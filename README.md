This is a simple collection of VBA Code that I've written in the past (and perhaps some new stuff once-in-a-while).

## [GetSummary.bas](https://github.com/joseph4tw/VBA-Library/blob/master/GetSummary.bas)

This is a UDF that will get the summary of a long text string by specifying the amount of words you want.

### Examples

```vba
=GetSummary("This is much longer than it needs to be.", 4)

' returns "This is much longer..."
```
