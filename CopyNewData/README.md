# Copy New Data

This is an example of how to copy new data from one module to another.

`Sheet1.bas` contains the code for the Worksheet that you want to copy data from.

`CopyNewDataModule.bas` contains the code for actually copying data to another sheet (`Sheet2` in this case).

A blog post has been written about it [here](https://www.spreadsheetsmadeeasy.com/copy-new-data-vba/).
